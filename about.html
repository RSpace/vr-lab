      <h1>VR:LAB</h1>

      <h3>WHAT</h3>
      <p>VR:LAB is an exploration of virtual reality (VR) as a medium and an expression. It is an intense production workshop where engaged artists from several countries gather to challenge the cinematic dogmas and collectively find a unique voice for VR by experimenting with new types of storytelling mechanisms.</p>
      <p>The purpose of VR:LAB is to encourage and unlock the new possibilities that VR has brought, to experiment and see what happens when creativity meets technology, and to let the Nordic voices be heard on a global scene.</p>

      <h3>THE CONDITIONS OF VR:LAB</h3>
      <p>20 carefully selected participants, all within the field of art and cinema, are invited to produce a short VR experience. During the workshop, the participants will be paired in 10 teams and all the teams will receive a minimal production budget and a point of view VR camera kit, which will include a binaural sound recording kit for a three dimensional sound environment.</p>

      <h3>WHO</h3>
      <p>VR:LAB is an initiative which was first created and installed by CPH:DOX and Makropol in the fall of 2015. VR:LAB is open for all curious souls and will facilitate several events with both industry and external stakeholders. It aims to be a yearly recurring event with a growing international and national audience.</p>

      <h2>UPCOMING EVENTS</h2>

      <h3>VR:LAB - PEER REVIEW</h3>
      <p>VR:LAB is exhibiting 9 VR installations at this years FOKUS Video Art Festival together with Nikolaj Kunsthal between the 11th of February to the 6th of March.</p>
      <p>During the VR:LAB in 2015, 18 artists explored the VR medium and created their take on how to experience a narrative through this medium. As a result 9 VR installations are now available for a bigger audience to explore.</p>
      <p>PEER:REVIEW is an active exhibition where we encourage audience to grap a lab coat and study the efforts of each VR installation, explore them and note questions and findings in a notebook placed in the coats.</p>
      <p>In other words, we want to involve the audience  in the dialog of films in virtual reality.</p>
